## Problem Statement

In today’s digital world, there are so many things that can be maintained “offline.” 
i.e., You have purchased a pair of jeans form a shop. Unfortunately, you missed the invoice. The shop owner is not willingly ready to give a warranty without a physical invoice.

Another example is on every year you have to pay the insurance premium; if you don’t pay it on time, they will charge additional cost. So it is important you got notifiy before due date.

## Proposed Solution

We will lend a helping hand by creating an application that will scan a copy of your invoice or document with additional information like seller/company, invoice date, category, amount, properties. The application will be a handy option for searching for documents in an emergency or genuine need.

## Quality

I want you to comeup with out of the box ideas. Do your best as if you are facing real problems with managing physical documents.  Make sure to give special attention to UI and importance to UX – functionalities. I want you to think like you are creating the next fortune 500 application for millions of users like Netflix.

## Tech Stack

You can use backend and frontend as your choice.
